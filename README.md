## About the Supplemental Instruction (SI) Programme

The SI Programme is an internationally recognised academic support initiative that targets historically challenging modules. It engages academically successful students to serve as SI Leaders — peers who guide others through structured group learning sessions while attending regular classes with them.

SI aims to improve student performance, academic confidence, and module completion rates through collaborative learning.
